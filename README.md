# WhatsBot

WhatsApp bot to get last messages from a conversation.

# Info
It's not quite a bot, but rather a Discord integration to receive messages from a given conversation or group of conversations.
It will be necessary at installation to modify the url of the webhook used in the `webhooks.py` file.

There is also an SoWeSign code integration. If a number with the format NNNNN is given inside a message, it will ping all Discord users with the @everyone tag.
